## Description
---
This is a refactor of React's ContextAPI into Redux.  The app was originally written with pure React.  I then imported Redux and changed all code to use the Redux global store instead of React.
    

    
## Installation
---
No install necessary.


    
## Usage
---
The app is deployed to Heroku.

    
## Credits
---
Thank you to:
The original source code was developed as a module during my time in University of Arizona's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.
